# which requires sudo access on most servers. Also, this creates a problem for the shared
# development systems (e.g., build servers).

# Therefore we are setting the installation directory so that by defult "make install"
# won't override artifacts generated by other users.
#
# The user can always override this by using the cmake command listed below.
