            https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/144 for full details on how the FV scheme works.
            For better performance, SEAL implements the "FullRNS" optimization of FV, as 
            described in https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/510.
            */

            /*
            The first task is to set up an instance of the EncryptionParameters class.
            It is critical to understand how these different parameters behave, how they
            affect the encryption scheme, performance, and the security level. There are 
            three encryption parameters that are necessary to set: 

                - PolyModulus (polynomial modulus);
                - CoeffModulus ([ciphertext] coefficient modulus);
                - PlainModulus (plaintext modulus).

            A fourth parameter -- NoiseStandardDeviation -- has a default value of 3.19 
            and should not be necessary to modify unless the user has a specific reason 
            to and knows what they are doing.

            The encryption scheme implemented in SEAL cannot perform arbitrary computations
            on encrypted data. Instead, each ciphertext has a specific quantity called the
            `invariant noise budget' -- or `noise budget' for short -- measured in bits. 
            The noise budget of a freshly encrypted ciphertext (initial noise budget) is 
            determined by the encryption parameters. Homomorphic operations consume the 
            noise budget at a rate also determined by the encryption parameters. In SEAL 
            the two basic homomorphic operations are additions and multiplications, of 
            which additions can generally be thought of as being nearly free in terms of 
            noise budget consumption compared to multiplications. Since noise budget 
            consumption is compounding in sequential multiplications, the most significant 
            factor in choosing appropriate encryption parameters is the multiplicative 
            depth of the arithmetic circuit that needs to be evaluated. Once the noise 
            budget in a ciphertext reaches zero, it becomes too corrupted to be decrypted. 
            Thus, it is essential to choose the parameters to be large enough to support 
            the desired computation; otherwise the result is impossible to make sense of 
            even with the secret key.
            */

            /*
            We first set the polynomial modulus. This must be a power-of-2 cyclotomic 
            polynomial, i.e. a polynomial of the form "1x^(power-of-2) + 1". The polynomial
            modulus should be thought of mainly affecting the security level of the scheme;
            larger polynomial modulus makes the scheme more secure. At the same time, it
            makes ciphertext sizes larger, and consequently all operations slower. Recommended
            degrees for PolyModulus are 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, but it is also 
            possible to go beyond this. Since we perform only a very small computation in this 
            example, it suffices to use a very small polynomial modulus.

            /*
            Next we choose the [ciphertext] coefficient modulus (CoeffModulus). The size of 
            the coefficient modulus should be thought of as the most significant factor in 
            determining the noise budget in a freshly encrypted ciphertext: bigger means
            more noise budget. Unfortunately, a larger coefficient modulus also lowers the
            security level of the scheme. Thus, if a large noise budget is required for
            complicated computations, a large coefficient modulus needs to be used, and the
            reduction in the security level must be countered by simultaneously increasing
            the polynomial modulus. 

            To make parameter selection easier for the user, we have constructed sets of 
            largest allowed coefficient moduli for 128-bit and 192-bit security levels
            for different choices of the polynomial modulus. These recommended parameters
            follow the Security white paper at http://HomomorphicEncryption.org. However,
            due to the complexity of this topic, we highly recommend the user to directly 
            consult an expert in homomorphic encryption and RLWE-based encryption schemes 
            to determine the security of their parameter choices. 

            Our recommended values for the coefficient modulus can be easily accessed 
            through the functions 
            
                DefaultParams.CoeffModulus128(int)
                DefaultParams.CoeffModulus192(int)

            for 128-bit and 192-bit security levels. The integer parameter is the degree
            of the polynomial modulus.

            In SEAL the coefficient modulus is a positive composite number -- a product
            of distinct primes of size up to 60 bits. When we talk about the size of the 
            coefficient modulus we mean the bit length of the product of the small primes. 
            The small primes are represented by instances of the SmallModulus class; for 
            example DefaultParams.CoeffModulus128(int) returns a vector of SmallModulus 
            instances. 

            It is possible for the user to select their own small primes. Since SEAL uses
            the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) for polynomial multiplications modulo the
            factors of the coefficient modulus, the factors need to be prime numbers
            congruent to 1 modulo 2*degree(PolyModulus). We have generated a list of such
            prime numbers of various sizes, that the user can easily access through the
            functions 
            
                DefaultParams.SmallMods60bit(int)
                DefaultParams.SmallMods50bit(int)
                DefaultParams.SmallMods40bit(int)
                DefaultParams.SmallMods30bit(int)

            each of which gives access to an array of primes of the denoted size. These 
            primes are located in the source file util/globals.cpp in the C++ library.

            Performance is mainly affected by the size of the polynomial modulus, and the
            number of prime factors in the coefficient modulus. Thus, it is important to
            use as few factors in the coefficient modulus as possible.

            In this example we use the default coefficient modulus for a 128-bit security
            level. Concretely, this coefficient modulus consists of only one 56-bit prime 
            factor: 0xfffffffff00001.

            Plaintexts in the FV scheme are polynomials with coefficients integers modulo 
            plain_modulus. To encrypt for example integers instead, one can use an 
            `encoding scheme' to represent the integers as such polynomials. SEAL comes 
            with a few basic encoders:

            [IntegerEncoder]
            Given an integer base b, encodes integers as plaintext polynomials as follows. 
            First, a base-b expansion of the integer is computed. This expansion uses 
            a `balanced' set of representatives of integers modulo b as the coefficients. 
            Namely, when b is odd the coefficients are integers between -(b-1)/2 and 
            (b-1)/2. When b is even, the integers are between -b/2 and (b-1)/2, except 
            when b is two and the usual binary expansion is used (coefficients 0 and 1). 
            Decoding amounts to evaluating the polynomial at x=b. For example, if b=2, 
            the integer 

                26 = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1

            is encoded as the polynomial 1x^4 + 1x^3 + 1x^1. When b=3, 

                26 = 3^3 - 3^0 

            is encoded as the polynomial 1x^3 - 1. In memory polynomial coefficients are 
            always stored as unsigned integers by storing their smallest non-negative 
            representatives modulo PlainModulus. To create a base-b integer encoder, 
            use the constructor IntegerEncoder(PlainModulus, b). If no b is given, b=2 
            is used.

            [FractionalEncoder]
            The FractionalEncoder encodes fixed-precision rational numbers as follows. 
            It expands the number in a given base b, possibly truncating an infinite 
            fractional part to finite precision, e.g. 

                26.75 = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^(-1) + 2^(-2) 

            when b=2. For the sake of the example, suppose PolyModulus is 1x^1024 + 1. 
            It then represents the integer part of the number in the same way as in 
            IntegerEncoder (with b=2 here), and moves the fractional part instead to the 
            highest degree part of the polynomial, but with signs of the coefficients 
            changed. In this example we would represent 26.75 as the polynomial 

                -1x^1023 - 1x^1022 + 1x^4 + 1x^3 + 1x^1. 

            In memory the negative coefficients of the polynomial will be represented as 
            their negatives modulo PlainModulus.

            [PolyCRTBuilder]
            If PlainModulus is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 2*degree(PolyModulus), the 
            plaintext elements can be viewed as 2-by-(degree(PolyModulus) / 2) matrices
            with elements integers modulo PlainModulus. When a desired computation can be
            vectorized, using PolyCRTBuilder can result in massive performance improvements 
            over naively encrypting and operating on each input number separately. Thus, 
            in more complicated computations this is likely to be by far the most important 
            and useful encoder. In ExampleBatching() we show how to use and operate on 
            encrypted matrix plaintexts.

            For performance reasons, in homomorphic encryption one typically wants to keep
            the plaintext data types as small as possible, which can make it challenging to 
            prevent data type overflow in more complicated computations, especially when 
            operating on rational numbers that have been scaled to integers. When using 
            PolyCRTBuilder estimating whether an overflow occurs is a fairly standard task, 
            as the matrix slots are integers modulo PlainModulus, and each slot is operated 
            on independently of the others. When using IntegerEncoder or FractionalEncoder
            it is substantially more difficult to estimate when an overflow occurs in the 
            plaintext, and choosing the plaintext modulus very carefully to be large enough 
            is critical to avoid unexpected results. Specifically, one needs to estimate how 
            large the largest coefficient in  the polynomial view of all of the plaintext 
            elements becomes, and choose the plaintext modulus to be larger than this value. 
            SEAL comes with an automatic parameter selection tool that can help with this 
            task, as is demonstrated in ExampleParameterSelection().

            Here we choose to create an IntegerEncoder with base b=2.

            The problem here is that homomorphic operations on large ciphertexts are
            computationally much more costly than on small ciphertexts. Specifically,
            homomorphic multiplication on input ciphertexts of size M and N will require 
            O(M*N) polynomial multiplications to be performed, and an addition will
            require O(M+N) additions. Relinearization reduces the size of the ciphertexts
            after multiplication back to the initial size (2). Thus, relinearizing one
            or both inputs before the next multiplication, or e.g. before serializing the
            ciphertexts, can have a huge positive impact on performance.

            Another problem is that the noise budget consumption in multiplication is
            bigger when the input ciphertexts sizes are bigger. In a complicated
            computation the contribution of the sizes to the noise budget consumption
            can actually become the dominant term. We will point this out again below
            once we get to our example.

            Relinearization itself has both a computational cost and a noise budget cost.
            These both depend on a parameter called `decomposition bit count', which can
            be any integer at least 1 [DefaultParms.DBCmin] and at most 60 [DefaultParams.DBCmax]. 
            A large decomposition bit count makes relinearization fast, but consumes
            more noise budget. A small decomposition bit count can make relinearization 
            slower, but might not change the noise budget by any observable amount.

            Relinearization requires a special type of key called `evaluation keys'.
            These can be created by the KeyGenerator for any decomposition bit count.
            To relinearize a ciphertext of size M >= 2 back to size 2, we actually need 
            M-2 evaluation keys. Attempting to relinearize a too large ciphertext with
            too few evaluation keys will result in an exception being thrown.

            We repeat our computation, but this time relinearize after both squarings.
            Since our ciphertext never grows past size 3 (we relinearize after every
            multiplication), it suffices to generate only one evaluation key.

            First, we need to create evaluation keys. We use a decomposition bit count 
            of 16 here, which can be thought of as quite small.

                  remains as small as possible. Recall from above that operations
                  on larger ciphertexts actually cause more noise growth.

            However, note that the second relinearization does not change the noise
            budget by any observable amount. This is very important to understand when
            optimal performance is desired: relinearization always drops the noise
            budget from the maximum (freshly encrypted ciphertext) down to a fixed 
            amount depending on the encryption parameters and the decomposition bit 
            count. On the other hand, homomorphic multiplication always consumes the
            noise budget from its current level. This is why the second relinearization
            does not change the noise budget anymore: it is already consumed past the
            fixed amount determinted by the decomposition bit count and the encryption
            parameters. 

            We now perform a third squaring and observe an even further compounded
            decrease in the noise budget. Again, relinearization does not consume the

            possible decomposition bit count.

            cyclically, and same for the columns (i.e. swap the two rows). For this we need
            the Galois keys that we generated earlier.

            budget is consumed down to some bound determined by the decomposition bit count 
            and the encryption parameters. For example, after some multiplications have 
            been performed, rotations might practically for free (noise budget-wise), but
            might be relatively expensive when the noise budget is nearly full, unless
            a small decomposition bit count is used, which again is computationally costly.
