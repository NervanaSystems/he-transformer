    /**
    Class to store a plaintext element. The data for the plaintext is a polynomial with coefficients
    modulo the plaintext modulus. The degree of the plaintext polynomial must be one less than the 
    degree of the polynomial modulus. The backing array always allocates one 64-bit word per each
    coefficient of the polynoimal.

    @par Memory Management
    SEAL allocates the memory for a plaintext by default from the global memory pool, but a user can
    alternatively specify a different memory pool to be used through the MemoryPoolHandle class. This
    can be important, as constructing or resizing several plaintexts at once allocated in the global
    memory pool can quickly lead to contention and poor performance in multi-threaded applications.
    In addition to its coefficient count, a plaintext also has a capacity which denotes the coefficient
    count that fits in the current allocation. Since each coefficient is a 64-bit word, this is exactly
    the number of 64-bit words that are allocated. In high-performance applications unnecessary 
    re-allocations should also be avoided by reserving enough memory for the plaintext to begin with 
    either by providing the capacity to the constructor as an extra argument, or by calling the reserve 
    function at any time.

    @par Aliased Plaintexts
    By default a plaintext manages its own memory. However, in some cases the user might want to e.g.
    pre-allocate a large continuous block of memory to be used by several plaintexts. In this case
    it is possible to create aliased plaintextds by simply giving the constructor a pointer to the
    memory location, and the relevant size parameters, including the capacity. The allocation size of
    an aliased plaintext cannot be changed with the reserve function, unless it is first reallocated
    in a memory pool using the unalias function.

    @par Thread Safety
    In general, reading from plaintext is thread-safe as long as no other thread is concurrently
    mutating it. This is due to the underlying data structure storing the plaintext not being
    thread-safe.

    @see Ciphertext for the class that stores ciphertexts.
