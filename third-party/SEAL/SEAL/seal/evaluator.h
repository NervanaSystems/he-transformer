    /**
    Provides operations on ciphertexts. Due to the properties of the encryption scheme,
    the arithmetic operations pass through the encryption layer to the underlying plaintext,
    changing it according to the type of the operation. Since the plaintext elements are
    fundamentally polynomials in the polynomial quotient ring Z_T[x]/(X^N+1), where T is
    the plaintext modulus and X^N+1 is the polynomial modulus, this is the ring where the
    arithmetic operations will take place. PolyCRTBuilder (batching) provider an alternative
    possibly more convenient view of the plaintext elements as 2-by-(N2/2) matrices of
    integers modulo the plaintext modulus. In the batching view the arithmetic operations
    act on the matrices element-wise. Some of the operations only apply in the batching
    view, such as matrix row and column rotations. Other operations such as relinearization
    have no semantic meaning but are necessary for performance reasons.
    
    @par Arithmetic Operations
    The core operations are arithmetic operations, in particular multiplication and addition 
    of ciphertexts. In addition to these, we also provide negation, subtraction, squaring,
    exponentiation, and multiplication and addition of several ciphertexts for convenience.
    in many cases some of the inputs to a computation are plaintext elements rather than
    ciphertexts. For this we provide fast "plain" operations: plain addition, plain subtraction,
    aand plain multiplication.

    @par Relinearization
    One of the most important non-arithmetic operations is relinearization, which takes
    as input a ciphertext of size K+1 and evaluation keys (at least K-1 keys are needed),
    and changes the size of the ciphertext down to 2 (minimum size). For most use-cases only 
    one evaluation key suffices, in which case relinearization should be performed after every 
    multiplication. Homomorphic multiplication of ciphertexts of size K+1 and L+1 outputs 
    a ciphertext of size K+L+1, and the computational cost of multiplication is proportional
    to K*L. Plain multiplication and addition operations of any type do not change the size.
    The performance of relinearization is determined by the decomposition bit count that the 
    evaluation keys were generated with.

    @par Rotations
    When batching is enabled, we provide operations for rotating the plaintext matrix rows
    cyclically left or right, and for rotating the columns (swapping the rows). Rotations
    require Galois keys to have been generated, and their performance depends on the
    decomposition bit count that the Galois keys were generated with.

    @par Other Operations
    We also provide operations for transforming ciphertexts to NTT form and back, and for
    transforming plaintext polynomials to NTT form. These can be used in a very fast plain
    multiplication variant, that assumes the inputs to be in NTT transformed form. Since
    the NTT has to be done in any case in plain multiplication, this function can be used
    when e.g. one plaintext input is used in several plain multiplication, and transforming
    it several times would not make sense.

    @par Overloads
    For many functions we provide two flavors of overloads. In one set of overloads the
    operations act on the inputs "in place", overwriting typically the first of the input
    parameters with the result, whereas the opposite set of overloads take a destination
    parameter where the result is stored. The first of these is always faster, and should
    be preferred when performance is critical. Another flavor of overloads concerns the
    memory pool used in allocations needed during the operation. In one set of overloads
    the local memory pool of the Evaluator (used to store pre-computation results and
    other member variables) is used for this purpose, and in another set of overloads the
    user can supply a MemoryPoolHandle to to be used instead. This is to allow one single 
    Evaluator to be used concurrently by several threads without running into thread 
    contention in allocations taking place during operations. For example, one can share 
    one single Evaluator across any number of threads, but in each thread call the 
    operations by giving them a thread-local MemoryPoolHandle to use. Thus, for many 
    operations we provide up to four different overloads, and it is important for 
    a developer to understand how these work to avoid unnecessary performance bottlenecks.
