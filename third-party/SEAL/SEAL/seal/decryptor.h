    /**
    Decrypts Ciphertext objects into Plaintext objects. Constructing a Decryptor requires
    a SEALContext with valid encryption parameters, and the secret key. The Decryptor is
    also used to compute the invariant noise budget in a given ciphertext.

    @par Overloads
    For the decrypt function we provide two overloads concerning the memory pool used in
    allocations needed during the operation. In one overload the local memory pool of
    the Decryptor (used to store pre-computation results and other member variables) is
    used for this purpose, and in another overload the user can supply
    a MemoryPoolHandle to to be used instead. This is to allow one single Decryptor to
    be used concurrently by several threads without running into thread contention in
    allocations taking place during operations. For example, one can share one single
    Decryptor across any number of threads, but in each thread call the decrypt function
    by giving it a thread-local MemoryPoolHandle to use. It is important for a developer
    to understand how this works to avoid unnecessary performance bottlenecks.

        budget as -log2(2v). Thus, the invariant noise budget starts from some initial value, 
        which depends on the encryption parameters, and decreases when computations are performed.
