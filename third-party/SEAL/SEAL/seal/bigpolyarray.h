    /**
    Represents an array of BigPoly objects. The BigPolyArray class provides all of the functionality of 
    a BigPoly array. The size of the array (which can be read with size()) is set initially by the constructor 
    and can be resized either with the resize() function or with assignment (operator=()). Each polynomial in 
    the array must have the same coefficient count and coefficient bit count, which can be set in the constructor
    or with the resize() function, and read with coeff_count() and coeff_bit_count(). The array can be saved and 
    loaded from a stream with the save() and load() functions.

    All of the polynomials in the array are stored in one continuous block in memory.

    @par Thread Safety
    In general, reading from a BigPolyArray instance is thread-safe while mutating is not. Specifically, the array
    may be freed whenever a resize() occurs, the BigPolyArray instance is destroyed, or an assignment operation 
    occurs. A BigPolyArray allocates its backing array from the global (thread-safe) memory pool. Consequently, 
    creating or resizing a large number of BigPolyArrays can result in performance loss due to thread contention.
