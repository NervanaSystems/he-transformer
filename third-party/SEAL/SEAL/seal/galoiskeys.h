    Class to store Galois keys.

    @par Slot Rotations
    Galois keys are used together with batching (PolyCRTBuilder). If the polynomial modulus
    is a polynomial of degree N, in batching the idea is to view a plaintext polynomial as
    a 2-by-(N/2) matrix of integers modulo plaintext modulus. Normal homomorphic computations
    operate on such encrypted matrices element (slot) wise. However, special rotation
    operations allow us to also rotate the matrix rows cyclically in either direction, and 
    rotate the columns (swap the rows). These operations require the Galois keys.

    @par Decomposition Bit Count
    Decomposition bit count (dbc) is a parameter that describes a performance trade-off in
    the rotation operation. Its function is exactly the same as in relinearization. Namely, 
    the polynomials in the ciphertexts (with large coefficients) get decomposed into a smaller
    base 2^dbc, coefficient-wise. Each of the decomposition factors corresponds to a piece of 
    data in the Galois keys, so the smaller the dbc is, the larger the Galois keys are. 
    Moreover, a smaller dbc results in less invariant noise budget being consumed in the
    rotation operation. However, using a large dbc is much faster, and often one would want 
    to optimize the dbc to be as large as possible for performance. The dbc is upper-bounded 
    by the value of 60, and lower-bounded by the value of 1.

    @par Thread Safety
    In general, reading from GaloisKeys is thread-safe as long as no other thread is 
    concurrently mutating it. This is due to the underlying data structure storing the
    Galois keys not being thread-safe.

    @see SecretKey for the class that stores the secret key.
    @see PublicKey for the class that stores the public key.
    @see EvaluationKeys for the class that stores the evaluation keys.
    @see KeyGenerator for the class that generates the Galois keys.
