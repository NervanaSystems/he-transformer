    /**
    Provides functionality for CRT batching. If the polynomial modulus is X^N+1, and the 
    plaintext modulus is a prime number T such that T is congruent to 1 modulo 2N, then 
    PolyCRTBuilder allows the SEAL plaintext elements to be viewed as 2-by-(N/2) matrices 
    of integers modulo T. Homomorphic operations performed on such encrypted matrices are 
    applied coefficient (slot) wise, enabling powerful SIMD functionality for computations 
    that are vectorizable. This functionality is often called "batching" in the homomorphic 
    encryption literature.

    @par Mathematical Background
    Mathematically speaking, if poly_modulus is X^N+1, N is a power of two, and plain_modulus
    is a prime number T such that 2N divides T-1, then integers modulo T contain a primitive
    2N-th root of unity and the polynomial X^N+1 splits into n distinct linear factors as
    X^N+1 = (X-a_1)*...*(X-a_N) mod T, where the constants a_1, ..., a_n are all the distinct
    primitive 2N-th roots of unity in integers modulo T. The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)
    states that the plaintext space Z_T[X]/(X^N+1) in this case is isomorphic (as an algebra)
    to the N-fold direct product of fields Z_T. The isomorphism is easy to compute explicitly
    in both directions, which is what this class does. Furthermore, the Galois group of the
    extension is (Z/2NZ)* ~= Z/2Z x Z/(N/2) whose action on the primitive roots of unity is
    easy to describe. Since the batching slots correspond 1-to-1 to the primitive roots of
    unity, applying Galois automorphisms on the plaintext act by permuting the slots. By
    applying generators of the two cyclic subgroups of the Galois group, we can effectively 
    view the plaintext as a 2-by-(N/2) matrix, and enable cyclic row rotations, and column 
    rotations (row swaps).

    @par Valid Parameters
    Whether batching can be used depends on whether the plaintext modulus has been chosen
    appropriately. Thus, to construct a PolyCRTBuilder the user must provide an instance 
    of SEALContext such that its associated EncryptionParameterQualifiers object has the 
    flags parameters_set and enable_batching set to true.

    @par Overloads
    For the decompose function we provide two overloads concerning the memory pool used in 
    allocations needed during the operation. In one overload the local memory pool of the 
    PolyCRTBuilder (used to store pre-computation results and other member variables) is used 
    for this purpose, and in another overload the user can supply a MemoryPoolHandle to to be 
    used instead. This is to allow one single PolyCRTBuilder to be used concurrently by 
    several threads without running into thread contention in allocations taking place during 
    operations. For example, one can share one single PolyCRTBuilder across any number of 
    threads, but in each thread call the encrypt function by giving it a thread-local 
    MemoryPoolHandle to use. It is important for a developer to understand how this works to 
    avoid unnecessary performance bottlenecks.

    @see EncryptionParameterQualifiers for more information about parameter qualifiers.
    @see Evaluator for rotating rows and columns of encrypted matrices.
