    /**
    Manages a shared pointer to a memory pool. SEAL uses memory pools for 
    improved performance due to the large number of memory allocations needed
    by the homomorphic encryption operations, and the underlying polynomial 
    arithmetic. The library automatically creates a shared global memory pool
    that is used for all dynamic allocations by default, and the user can
    optionally create any number of custom memory pools to be used instead.
    
    @Uses in Multi-Threaded Applications
    Sometimes the user might want to use specific memory pools for dynamic
    allocations in certain functions. For example, in heavily multi-threaded
    applications allocating concurrently from a shared memory pool might lead 
    to significant performance issues due to thread contention. For these cases
    SEAL provides overloads of the functions that take a MemoryPoolHandle as an
    additional argument, and uses the associated memory pool for all dynamic
    allocations inside the function. Whenever this functions is called, the 
    user can then simply pass a thread-local MemoryPoolHandle to be used.
    
    @Thread-Unsafe Memory Pools
    While memory pools are by default thread-safe, in some cases it suffices
    to have a memory pool be thread-unsafe. To get a little extra performance,
    the user can optionally create such thread-unsafe memory pools and use them
    just as they would use thread-safe memory pools.

    @Initialized and Uninitialized Handles
    A MemoryPoolHandle has to be set to point either to the global memory pool,
    or to a new memory pool. If this is not done, the MemoryPoolHandle is
    said to be uninitialized, and cannot be used. Initialization simple means
    assigning MemoryPoolHandle::Global() or MemoryPoolHandle::New() to it.

    @Managing Lifetime
    Internally, the MemoryPoolHandle wraps an std::shared_ptr pointing to
    a SEAL memory pool class. Thus, as long as a MemoryPoolHandle pointing to
    a particular memory pool exists, the pool stays alive. Classes such as
    Evaluator and Ciphertext store their own local copies of a MemoryPoolHandle
    to guarantee that the pool stays alive as long as the managing object 
    itself stays alive. The global memory pool is implemented as a global
    std::shared_ptr to a memory pool class, and is thus expected to stay
    alive for the entire duration of the program execution. Note that it can
    be problematic to create other global objects that use the memory pool
    e.g. in their constructor, as one would have to ensure the initialization
    order of these global variables to be correct (i.e. global memory pool
    first).
