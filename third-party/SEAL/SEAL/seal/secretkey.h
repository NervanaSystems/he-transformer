    Class to store a secret key. Internally, the secret key is represented

    @par Thread Safety
    In general, reading from SecretKey is thread-safe as long as no other 
    thread is concurrently mutating it. This is due to the underlying data 
    structure storing the secret key not being thread-safe.

    @see KeyGenerator for the class that generates the secret key.
    @see PublicKey for the class that stores the public key.
    @see EvaluationKeys for the class that stores the evaluation keys.
    @see GaloisKeys for the class that stores the Galois keys.
