    /**
    Class to store evaluation keys. An evaluation key has type std::vector<Ciphertext>.
    An instance of the EvaluationKeys class stores internally an std::vector of evaluation
    keys.
    
    @par Relinearization
    Concretely, an evaluation key corresponding to a power K of the secret key can be used
    in the relinearization operation to change a ciphertext of size K+1 to size K. Recall
    that the smallest possible size for a ciphertext is 2, so the first evaluation key is
    corresponds to the square of the secret key. The second evaluation key corresponds to
    the cube of the secret key, and so on. For example, to relinearize a ciphertext of size
    7 back to size 2, one would need 5 evaluation keys, although it is hard to imagine 
    a situation where it makes sense to have size 7 ciphertexts, as operating on such objects
    would be very slow. Most commonly only one evaluation key is needed, and relinearization
    is performed after every multiplication.

    @par Decomposition Bit Count
    Decomposition bit count (dbc) is a parameter that describes a performance trade-off in
    the relinearization process. Namely, in the relinearization process the polynomials in 
    the ciphertexts (with large coefficients) get decomposed into a smaller base 2^dbc,
    coefficient-wise. Each of the decomposition factors corresponds to a piece of data in
    the evaluation key, so the smaller the dbc is, the larger the evaluation keys are.
    Moreover, a smaller dbc results in less invariant noise budget being consumed in the
    relinearization process. However, using a large dbc is much faster, and often one 
    would want to optimize the dbc to be as large as possible for performance. The dbc is 
    upper-bounded by the value of 60, and lower-bounded by the value of 1.

    @par Thread Safety
    In general, reading from EvaluationKeys is thread-safe as long as no other thread is
    concurrently mutating it. This is due to the underlying data structure storing the 
    evaluation keys not being thread-safe.

    @see SecretKey for the class that stores the secret key.
    @see PublicKey for the class that stores the public key.
    @see GaloisKeys for the class that stores the Galois keys.
    @see KeyGenerator for the class that generates the evaluation keys.
