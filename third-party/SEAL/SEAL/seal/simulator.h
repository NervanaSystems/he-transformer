    /**
    Models the invariant noise budget in a ciphertext based on given encryption 
    parameters. When performing arithmetic operations on encrypted data, the 
    quality of the ciphertexts will degrade, i.e. the invariant noise budget 
    will be consumed, until at a certain point the budget will reach 0, and 
    decryption will fail to work. The Simulation object together with 
    SimulationEvaluator can help the user understand how the invariant noise 
    budget is consumed in different homomorphic operations, and to adjust the 
    encryption parameters accordingly.

    Instances of Simulation can be manipulated using SimulationEvaluator, which 
    has a public API similar to Evaluator, making existing code easy to run on 
    simulations instead of running it on actual encrypted data. In other words, 
    using SimulationEvaluator, simulations can be added, multiplied, subtracted,
    negated, etc., and the result is always a new Simulation object whose noise 
    budget is obtained using heuristic worst-case analysis of the noise behavior 
    in the encryption scheme.

    @par Invariant Noise Budget
    The invariant noise polynomial of a ciphertext is a rational coefficient 
    polynomial, such that a ciphertext decrypts correctly as long as the 
    coefficients of the invariant noise polynomial are of absolute value less 
    than 1/2. Thus, we call the infinity-norm of the invariant noise polynomial
    the invariant noise, and for correct decryption require it to be less 
    than 1/2. If v denotes the invariant noise, we define the invariant noise 
    budget as -log2(2v). Thus, the invariant noise budget starts from some initial 
    value, which depends on the encryption parameters, and decreases to 0 when 
    computations are performed. When the budget reaches 0, the ciphertext becomes 
    too noisy to decrypt correctly.

    @see SimulationEvaluator for manipulating instances of Simulation.
