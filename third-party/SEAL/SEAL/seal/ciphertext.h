    /**
    Class to store a ciphertext element. The data for a ciphertext consists of two or more polynomials, 
    which are in SEAL stored in a CRT form with respect to the factors of the coefficient modulus. This
    data itself is not meant to be modified directly by the user, but is instead operated on by functions
    in the Evaluator class. The size of the backing array of a ciphertext depends on the encryption
    parameters and the size of the ciphertext (at least 2). If the degree of the poly_modulus encryption 
    parameter is N, and the number of primes in the coeff_modulus encryption parameter is K, then the 
    ciphertext backing array requires precisely 8*N*K*size bytes of memory. A ciphertext also carries
    with it the hash of its associated encryption parameters, which is used to check the validity of the
    ciphertext for homomorphic operations and decryption.

    @par Memory Management
    SEAL allocates the memory for a ciphertext by default from the global memory pool, but a user can
    alternatively specify a different memory pool to be used through the MemoryPoolHandle class. This
    can be important, as constructing or resizing several ciphertexts at once allocated in the global
    memory pool can quickly lead to contention and poor performance in multi-threaded applications.
    In addition to its size which denotes the number of polynomials, a ciphertext also has a capacity
    which denotes the number of polynomials that fit in the current allocation. In high-performance
    applications unnecessary re-allocations should also be avoided by reserving enough memory for the
    ciphertext to begin with either by providing the capacity to the constructor as an extra argument,
    or by calling the reserve function at any time.

    @par Aliased Ciphertexts
    By default a ciphertext manages its own memory. However, in some cases the user might want to e.g.
    pre-allocate a large continuous block of memory to be used by several ciphertexts. In this case 
    it is possible to create aliased ciphertexts by simply giving the constructor a pointer to the
    memory location, and the relevant size parameters, including the capacity. The allocation size of
    an aliased ciphertext cannot be changed with the reserve function, unless it is first reallocated
    in a memory pool using the unalias function.

    @par Thread Safety
    In general, reading from ciphertext is thread-safe as long as no other thread is concurrently
    mutating it. This is due to the underlying data structure storing the ciphertext not being
    thread-safe.

    @see Plaintext for the class that stores plaintexts.
