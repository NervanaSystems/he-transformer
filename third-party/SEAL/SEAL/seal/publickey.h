    Class to store a public key. Internally, the public key is represented by

    @par Thread Safety
    In general, reading from PublicKey is thread-safe as long as no other thread
    is concurrently mutating it. This is due to the underlying data structure 
    storing the public key not being thread-safe.

    @see KeyGenerator for the class that generates the public key.
    @see SecretKey for the class that stores the secret key.
    @see EvaluationKeys for the class that stores the evaluation keys.
    @see GaloisKeys for the class that stores the Galois keys.
