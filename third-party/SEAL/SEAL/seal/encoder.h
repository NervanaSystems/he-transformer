    /**
    Encodes integers into plaintext polynomials that Encryptor can encrypt. An instance of
    the BinaryEncoder class converts an integer into a plaintext polynomial by placing its
    binary digits as the coefficients of the polynomial. Decoding the integer amounts to
    evaluating the plaintext polynomial at X=2.

    Addition and multiplication on the integer side translate into addition and multiplication
    on the encoded plaintext polynomial side, provided that the length of the polynomial
    never grows to be of the size of the polynomial modulus (poly_modulus), and that the
    coefficients of the plaintext polynomials appearing throughout the computations never
    experience coefficients larger than the plaintext modulus (plain_modulus).

    @par Negative Integers
    Negative integers are represented by using -1 instead of 1 in the binary representation,
    and the negative coefficients are stored in the plaintext polynomials as unsigned integers
    that represent them modulo the plaintext modulus. Thus, for example, a coefficient of -1
    would be stored as a polynomial coefficient plain_modulus-1.

    @par Decoding Overflow
    In many cases it is a bad idea to throw an exception when decoding fails due to an overflow
    condition, e.g. decode_uint32 is given a polynomial that decodes into a value larger than
    32 bits. If such an exception is not handled silently, a malicious observer might notice
    this happening, and be able to extract one bit of information about the secret key.
    Thus, by default, the decoder functions do not throw exceptions in cases of overflow.
    However, the throws are automatically enabled in debug mode in Visual Studio, and more
    generally they can be directly controlled by the preprocessor define SEAL_THROW_ON_DECODER_OVERFLOW
    in the file util/defines.h.

    /**
    Encodes floating point numbers into plaintext polynomials that Encryptor can encrypt.
    An instance of the BinaryFractionalEncoder class converts a double-precision floating-point
    number into a plaintext polynomial by computing its binary representation, encoding the
    integral part as in BinaryEncoder, and the fractional part as the highest degree
    terms of the plaintext polynomial, with signs inverted. Decoding the polynomial
    back into a double amounts to evaluating the low degree part at X=2, negating the
    coefficients of the high degree part and evaluating it at X=1/2.

    Addition and multiplication on the double side translate into addition and multiplication
    on the encoded plaintext polynomial side, provided that the integral part never mixes
    with the fractional part in the plaintext polynomials, and that the
    coefficients of the plaintext polynomials appearing throughout the computations never
    experience coefficients larger than the plaintext modulus (plain_modulus).

    @par Integral and Fractional Parts
    When homomorphic multiplications are performed, the integral part "grows up" to higher
    degree coefficients of the plaintext polynomial space, and the fractional part "grows down"
    from the top degree coefficients towards the lower degree coefficients. For decoding to work,
    these parts must not interfere with each other. When setting up the BinaryFractionalEncoder,
    one must specify how many coefficients of a plaintext polynomial are reserved for the integral
    part and how many for the fractional. The sum of these numbers can be at most equal to the
    degree of the polynomial modulus minus one. If homomorphic multiplications are performed, it is
    also necessary to leave enough room for the fractional part to "grow down".

    @par Negative Integers
    Negative integers are represented by using -1 instead of 1 in the binary representation,
    and the negative coefficients are stored in the plaintext polynomials as unsigned integers
    that represent them modulo the plaintext modulus. Thus, for example, a coefficient of -1
    would be stored as a polynomial coefficient plain_modulus-1.

    @par Decoding Overflow
    In many cases it is a bad idea to throw an exception when decoding fails due to an overflow
    condition, e.g. decode is given a polynomial whose integer part decodes into a value larger 
    than 64 bits. If such an exception is not handled silently, a malicious observer might notice
    this happening, and be able to extract one bit of information about the secret key.
    Thus, by default, the decoder functions do not throw exceptions in cases of overflow.
    However, the throws are automatically enabled in debug mode in Visual Studio, and more
    generally they can be directly controlled by the preprocessor define SEAL_THROW_ON_DECODER_OVERFLOW
    in the file util/defines.h.

    /**
    Encodes floating point numbers into plaintext polynomials that Encryptor can encrypt.
    An instance of the FractionalEncoder class converts a double-precision floating-point
    number into a plaintext polynomial by computing its balanced base-b representation, 
    encoding the integral part as in IntegerEncoder, and the fractional part as the highest 
    degree terms of the plaintext polynomial, with signs inverted. For an even base b, the
    coefficients of the polynomial are in the range -b/2,...,b/2-1. When b is 2, the
    coefficients are either all non-negative (0 and 1), or all non-positive (0 and -1).
    Decoding the polynomial back into a double amounts to evaluating the low degree part 
    at X=b, negating the coefficients of the high degree part and evaluating it at X=1/b.

    Addition and multiplication on the double side translate into addition and multiplication
    on the encoded plaintext polynomial side, provided that the integral part never mixes
    with the fractional part in the plaintext polynomials, and that the
    coefficients of the plaintext polynomials appearing throughout the computations never
    experience coefficients larger than the plaintext modulus (plain_modulus).

    @par Integral and Fractional Parts
    When homomorphic multiplications are performed, the integral part "grows up" to higher
    degree coefficients of the plaintext polynomial space, and the fractional part "grows down"
    from the top degree coefficients towards the lower degree coefficients. For decoding to work,
    these parts must not interfere with each other. When setting up the BalancedFractionalEncoder,
    one must specify how many coefficients of a plaintext polynomial are reserved for the integral
    part and how many for the fractional. The sum of these numbers can be at most equal to the
    degree of the polynomial modulus minus one. If homomorphic multiplications are performed, it is
    also necessary to leave enough room for the fractional part to "grow down".

    @par Negative Integers
    Negative integers in the base-b encoding are represented the same way as positive integers,
    namely, both positive and negative integers can have both positive and negative digits in their
    base-b representation. Negative coefficients are stored in the plaintext polynomials as unsigned
    integers that represent them modulo the plaintext modulus. Thus, for example, a coefficient of -1
    would be stored as a polynomial coefficient plain_modulus-1.

    @par Decoding Overflow
    In many cases it is a bad idea to throw an exception when decoding fails due to an overflow
    condition, e.g. decode is given a polynomial whose integer part decodes into a value larger than 64 bits.
    If such an exception is not handled silently, a malicious observer might notice
    this happening, and be able to extract one bit of information about the secret key.
    Thus, by default, the decoder functions do not throw exceptions in cases of overflow.
    However, the throws are automatically enabled in debug mode in Visual Studio, and more
    generally they can be directly controlled by the preprocessor define SEAL_THROW_ON_DECODER_OVERFLOW
    in the file util/defines.h.

    @par BinaryFractionalEncoder and BalancedFractionalEncoder
    Under the hood FractionalEncoder uses either the BinaryFractionalEncoder or the 
    BalancedFractionalEncoder classes to do the encoding. The first one is used when the base is 2, 
    and the second one when the base is at least 3. Currently the BinaryFractionalEncoder and 
    BalancedFractionalEncoder classes can also be used directly, but this might change in future releases.

    @see BinaryFractionalEncoder for encoding using the binary representation.
    @see BalancedFractionalEncoder for encoding using base-b representation for b greater than 2.
    @see IntegerEncoder for encoding integers.
