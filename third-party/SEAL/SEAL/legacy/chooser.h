    /**
    Models ciphertexts for the automatic parameter selection module. Choosing appropriate and secure
    parameters for homomorphic cryptosystems is difficult, and beyond what a non-expert user should have
    to worry about. The user programs their computations as they normally would, but replace plaintexts with
    ChooserPoly objects. When the program is executed, ChooserPoly objects store the computation as a directed
    acyclic graph, and can later be used to estimate the invariant noise budget consumption in the stored 
    computation. The estimated noise budget in the output ciphertext is given by the simulate() function. 
    This class is a part of the automatic parameter selection module.

    Each instance of ChooserPoly stores an estimate of the number of non-zero coefficients, and an estimate
    for their largest absolute value (represented by BigUInt) that a plaintext polynomial can be expected to
    contain after some number of homomorphic operations have been performed on it. In addition, each ChooserPoly
    stores a directed acyclic graph of computations that it has gone through (operation history).

    Instances of ChooserPoly can be manipulated using an instance of ChooserEvaluator, which has a public API
    similar to Evaluator, making existing code easy to run on ChooserPoly objects instead of running it on
    actual encrypted data. In other words, using ChooserEvaluator, ChooserPoly objects can be added, multiplied,
    subtracted, negated, etc., and the result is always a new ChooserPoly object whose estimated noise budget
    can be obtained using the simulate() function, which uses heuristic worst-case analysis of the noise 
    behavior in the encryption scheme. 

    @par Invariant Noise Budget
    The invariant noise polynomial of a ciphertext is a rational coefficient polynomial, such that
    a ciphertext decrypts correctly as long as the coefficients of the invariant noise polynomial are
    of absolute value less than 1/2. Thus, we call the infinity-norm of the invariant noise polynomial
    the invariant noise, and for correct decryption require it to be less than 1/2. If v denotes the
    invariant noise, we define the invariant noise budget as -log2(2v). Thus, the invariant noise budget
    starts from some initial value, which depends on the encryption parameters, and decreases to 0 when
    computations are performed. When the budget reaches 0, the ciphertext becomes too noisy to decrypt
    correctly.

    @par Thread Safety
    In general, reading a ChooserPoly is thread-safe while mutating is not. Specifically, concurrent access must
    be avoided if the size bounds of the modeled plaintext data, or the operation history are expected to be changed.

    @see ChooserEvaluator for manipulating instances of ChooserPoly.
    @see ChooserEncoder for modeling the behavior of encoding with ChooserPoly objects.
    @see ChooserEncryptor for modeling the behavior of encryption with ChooserPoly objects.
    @see Simulation for the class that handles the noise budget consumption estimates.
