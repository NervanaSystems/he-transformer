    Class to store evaluation keys. Internally, each instance stores a std::vector of objects 
    of type std::pair<BigPolyArray, BigPolyArray>, where the evaluation keys are stored. Each 
    entry of the vector is called an evaluation key. Each evaluation key is associated to a 
    particular power of the secret key, and can be repeatedly used by the relinearization 
    operation typically performed after homomorphic multiplication. The evaluation keys can be
    saved and loaded from a stream with the save() and load() functions.

    @par Thread Safety
    In general, reading from EvaluationKeys is thread-safe as long as no other thread is concurrently
    mutating it. This is due to the underlying data structure storing the evaluation keys not being 
    thread-safe.

    @see SecretKey for the class that stores the secret key.
    @see PublicKey for the class that stores the public key.
    @see KeyGenerator for the class that generates the evaluation keys.
