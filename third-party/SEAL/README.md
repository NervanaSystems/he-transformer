# Introduction
Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library (SEAL) is an easy-to-use homomorphic encryption 
library, developed by researchers in the Cryptography Research group at Microsoft Research. 
SEAL is written in C++, and contains .NET wrappers for the public API. SEAL is licensed
under the Microsoft Research License Agreement, and is free for research use (see LICENSE.txt).

# Documentation
A detailed manual for SEAL v2.2 is available [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/simple-encrypted-arithmetic-library-seal-v2-2/).
The manual for SEAL v2.3 will be available shortly.

The code-base contains examples written both in C++ and in C#. These examples are heavily commented, 
serving as a self-contained short introduction to using the library. In addition, the .h files both 
in the C++ library and in the .NET wrapper library contain detailed comments for the public API.

To learn to use SEAL, we recommend looking at the example projects, as they contain several detailed 
and thoroughly commented examples demonstrating most of the basic features.
