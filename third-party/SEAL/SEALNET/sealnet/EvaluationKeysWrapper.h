            <remarks>
            <para>
            Class to store evaluation keys. An evaluation key has type std::vector<Ciphertext> (C++).
            An instance of the EvaluationKeys class stores internally an std::vector (C++) of
            evaluation keys.
            </para>
            <para>
            Concretely, an evaluation key corresponding to a power K of the secret key can be used
            in the relinearization operation to change a ciphertext of size K+1 to size K. Recall
            that the smallest possible size for a ciphertext is 2, so the first evaluation key is
            corresponds to the square of the secret key. The second evaluation key corresponds to
            the cube of the secret key, and so on. For example, to relinearize a ciphertext of size
            7 back to size 2, one would need 5 evaluation keys, although it is hard to imagine
            a situation where it makes sense to have size 7 ciphertexts, as operating on such objects
            would be very slow. Most commonly only one evaluation key is needed, and relinearization
            is performed after every multiplication.
            </para>
            <para>
            Decomposition bit count (dbc) is a parameter that describes a performance trade-off in
            the relinearization process. Namely, in the relinearization process the polynomials in
            the ciphertexts (with large coefficients) get decomposed into a smaller base 2^dbc
            coefficient-wise. Each of the decomposition factors corresponds to a piece of data in
            the evaluation key, so the smaller the dbc is, the larger the evaluation keys are.
            Moreover, a smaller dbc results in less invariant noise budget being consumed in the
            relinearization process. However, using a large dbc results is much faster, and often
            one would want to optimize the dbc to be as large as possible for performance. The dbc
            is upper-bounded by the value of 60, and lower-bounded by the value of 1.

            <para>
            In general, reading from EvaluationKeys is thread-safe as long as no other thread is
            concurrently mutating it. This is due to the underlying data structure storing the
            evaluation keys not being thread-safe.
