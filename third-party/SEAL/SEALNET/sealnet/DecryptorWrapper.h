            <para>
            Decrypts <see cref="Ciphertext" /> objects into <see cref="Plaintext" /> objects. 
            Constructing a Decryptor requires a <see cref="SEALContext" /> with valid encryption 
            parameters, and the secret key. The Decryptor is also used to compute the invariant 
            noise budget in a given ciphertext.
            </para>
            <para>
            For the Decrypt function we provide two overloads concerning the memory pool used in
            allocations needed during the operation. In one overload the local memory pool of
            the Decryptor (used to store pre-computation results and other member variables) is
            used for this purpose, and in another overload the user can supply
            a <see cref="MemoryPoolHandle" /> to to be used instead. This is to allow one single
            Decryptor to be used concurrently by several threads without running into thread 
            contention in allocations taking place during operations. For example, one can share
            one single Decryptor across any number of threads, but in each thread call the 
            Decrypt function by giving it a thread-local <see cref="MemoryPoolHandle" /> to use. 
            It is important for a developer to understand how this works to avoid unnecessary 
            performance bottlenecks.
