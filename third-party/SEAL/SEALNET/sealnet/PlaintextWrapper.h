            <remarks>
            <para>
            Class to store a plaintext element. The data for the plaintext is a polynomial with coefficients
            modulo the plaintext modulus. The degree of the plaintext polynomial must be one less than the
            degree of the polynomial modulus. The backing array always allocates one 64-bit word per each
            coefficient of the polynoimal.
            </para>
            <para>
            SEAL allocates the memory for a plaintext by default from the global memory pool, but a user can
            alternatively specify a different memory pool to be used through the MemoryPoolHandle class. This
            can be important, as constructing or resizing several plaintexts at once allocated in the global
            memory pool can quickly lead to contention and poor performance in multi-threaded applications.
            In addition to its coefficient count, a plaintext also has a capacity which denotes the coefficient
            count that fits in the current allocation. Since each coefficient is a 64-bit word, this is exactly
            the number of 64-bit words that are allocated. In high-performance applications unnecessary
            re-allocations should also be avoided by reserving enough memory for the plaintext to begin with
            either by providing the capacity to the constructor as an extra argument, or by calling the reserve
            function at any time.
            </para>
            <para>
            In general, reading from plaintext is thread-safe as long as no other thread is concurrently
            mutating it. This is due to the underlying data structure storing the plaintext not being
            thread-safe.
