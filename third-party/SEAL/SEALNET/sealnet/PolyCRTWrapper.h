            <summary>Provides functionality for CRT batching.</summary>
            
            <remarks>
            Provides functionality for CRT batching. If the polynomial modulus is X^N+1, and the
            plaintext modulus is a prime number T such that T is congruent to 1 modulo 2N, then
            PolyCRTBuilder allows the SEAL plaintext elements to be viewed as 2-by-(N/2) matrices
            of integers modulo T. Homomorphic operations performed on such encrypted matrices are
            applied coefficient (slot) wise, enabling powerful SIMD functionality for computations
            that are vectorizable. This functionality is often called "batching" in the homomorphic
            encryption literature.

            Mathematically speaking, if PolyModulus is X^N+1, N is a power of two, and PlainModulus
            is a prime number T such that 2N divides T-1, then integers modulo T contain a primitive
            2N-th root of unity and the polynomial X^N+1 splits into n distinct linear factors as
            X^N+1 = (X-a_1)*...*(X-a_N) mod T, where the constants a_1, ..., a_n are all the distinct
            primitive 2N-th roots of unity in integers modulo T. The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)
            states that the plaintext space Z_T[X]/(X^N+1) in this case is isomorphic (as an algebra)
            to the N-fold direct product of fields Z_T. The isomorphism is easy to compute explicitly
            in both directions, which is what this class does. Furthermore, the Galois group of the
            extension is (Z/2NZ)* ~= Z/2Z x Z/(N/2) whose action on the primitive roots of unity is
            easy to describe. Since the batching slots correspond 1-to-1 to the primitive roots of
            unity, applying Galois automorphisms on the plaintext act by permuting the slots. By
            applying generators of the two cyclic subgroups of the Galois group, we can effectively
            view the plaintext as a 2-by-(N/2) matrix, and enable cyclic row rotations, and column
            rotations (row swaps).

            <para>
            Whether batching can be used depends on whether the plaintext modulus has been chosen
            appropriately. Thus, to construct a PolyCRTBuilder the user must provide an instance
            of <see cref="SEALContext" /> such that its associated EncryptionParameterQualifiers
            object has the flags ParametersSet and EnableBatching set to true.

            <para>
            For the decompose function we provide two overloads concerning the memory pool used in
            allocations needed during the operation. In one overload the local memory pool of the
            PolyCRTBuilder (used to store pre-computation results and other member variables) is used
            for this purpose, and in another overload the user can supply a <see cref="MemoryPoolHandle" />
            to to be used instead. This is to allow one single PolyCRTBuilder to be used concurrently 
            by several threads without running into thread contention in allocations taking place 
            during operations. For example, one can share one single PolyCRTBuilder across any number 
            of threads, but in each thread call the encrypt function by giving it a thread-local
            <see cref="MemoryPoolHandle" /> to use. It is important for a developer to understand how 
            this works to avoid unnecessary performance bottlenecks.
