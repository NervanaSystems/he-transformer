            <summary>Class to store a ciphertext element.</summary>

            <remarks>
            <para>
            Class to store a ciphertext element. The data for a ciphertext consists of two or more polynomials,
            which are in SEAL stored in a CRT form with respect to the factors of the coefficient modulus. This
            data itself is not meant to be modified directly by the user, but is instead operated on by functions
            in the <see cref="Evaluator" /> class. The size of the backing array of a ciphertext depends on the
            encryption parameters and the size of the ciphertext (at least 2). If the degree of the PolyModulus 
            encryption parameter is N, and the number of primes in the CoeffModulus encryption parameter is K,
            then the ciphertext backing array requires precisely 8*N*K*size bytes of memory. A ciphertext also 
            carries with it the hash of its associated encryption parameters, which is used to check the validity 
            of the ciphertext for homomorphic operations and decryption.
            </para>
            <para>
            SEAL allocates the memory for a ciphertext by default from the global memory pool, but a user can
            alternatively specify a different memory pool to be used through the <see cref="MemoryPoolHandle" />
            class. This can be important, as constructing or resizing several ciphertexts at once allocated in the 
            global memory pool can quickly lead to contention and poor performance in multi-threaded applications.
            In addition to its size which denotes the number of polynomials, a ciphertext also has a capacity which 
            denotes the number of polynomials that fit in the current allocation. In high-performance applications 
            unnecessary re-allocations should also be avoided by reserving enough memory for the ciphertext to 
            begin with either by providing the capacity to the constructor as an extra argument, or by calling the 
            <see cref="Reserve(EncryptionParameters^, int, MemoryPoolHandle^)" /> function at any time.
            </para>
            <para>
            In general, reading from ciphertext is thread-safe as long as no other thread is concurrently
            mutating it. This is due to the underlying data structure storing the ciphertext not being
            thread-safe.
