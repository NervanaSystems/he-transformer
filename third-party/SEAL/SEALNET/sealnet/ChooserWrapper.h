            <summary>Models ciphertexts for the automatic parameter selection 
            module.</summary>

            <remarks>
            <para>
            Models ciphertexts for the automatic parameter selection module. Choosing
            appropriate and secure parameters for homomorphic cryptosystems is difficult,
            and beyond what a non-expert user should have to worry about. The user 
            programs their computations as they normally would, but replace plaintexts 
            with ChooserPoly objects. When the program is executed, ChooserPoly objects
            store the computation as a directed graph, and can later be used to estimate
            the invariant noise budget consumption in the stored computation. The estimated
            noise budget in the output ciphertext is given by the  <see cref="Simulate()"/>
            function. This class is a part of the automatic parameter selection module.
            </para>
            <para>
            Each instance of ChooserPoly stores an estimate of the number of non-zero
            coefficients, and an estimate for their largest absolute value (represented
            by <see cref="BigUInt"/>) that a plaintext polynomial can be expected to 
            contain after some number of homomorphic operations have been performed on 
            it. In addition, each ChooserPoly stores a directed graph of computations
            that it has gone through (operation history).
            </para>
            <para>
            Instances of ChooserPoly can be manipulated using an instance of 
            <see cref="ChooserEvaluator"/>, which has a public API similar to Evaluator,
            making existing code easy to run on ChooserPoly objects instead of running 
            it on actual encrypted data. In other words, using <see cref="ChooserEvaluator"/>, 
            ChooserPoly objects can be added, multiplied, subtracted, negated, etc., and 
            the result is always a new ChooserPoly object whose estimated noise budget can
            be obtained using the <see cref="Simulate()"/> function, which uses heuristic
            worst-case analysis of the noise behavior in the encryption scheme.
            </para>
            <para>
            The invariant noise polynomial of a ciphertext is a rational coefficient 
            polynomial, such that a ciphertext decrypts correctly as long as the 
            coefficients of the invariant noise polynomial are of absolute value less 
            than 1/2. Thus, we call the infinity-norm of the invariant noise polynomial
            the invariant noise, and for correct decryption require it to be less 
            than 1/2. If v denotes the invariant noise, we define the invariant noise 
            budget as -log2(2v). Thus, the invariant noise budget starts from some initial 
            value, which depends on the encryption parameters, and decreases to 0 when 
            computations are performed. When the budget reaches 0, the ciphertext becomes
            too noisy to decrypt correctly.
            </para>
            <para>
            In general, reading a ChooserPoly is thread-safe while mutating is not. 
            Specifically, concurrent access must be avoided if the size bounds of the
            modeled plaintext data, or the operation history are expected to be changed.
