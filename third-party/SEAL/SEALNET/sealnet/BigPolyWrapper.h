            <summary>Represents a polynomial consisting of a set of unsigned integer coefficients with a specified 
            bit width.</summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            Represents a polynomial consisting of a set of unsigned integer coefficients with a specified bit width.
            BigPolys are mutable and able to be resized. Individual coefficients can be read/written through the
            indexer property. A BigPoly has a set coefficient count (which can be read with <see cref="CoeffCount"/>)
            and coefficient bit width (which can be read with <see cref="CoeffBitCount"/>), and all coefficients in 
            a BigPoly have the same bit width. The coefficient count and bit width of a BigPoly is set initially by 
            the constructor, and can be resized either explicitly with the <see cref="Resize()"/> function, or implicitly 
            with for example assignment.
            </para>

            <para>
            A BigPoly's coefficients are stored sequentially, index-zero coefficient first, in a contiguous System::UInt64
            array. The width of each coefficient is rounded up to the next System::UInt64 width (i.e., to the next 64-bit
            boundary). The <see cref="CoeffUInt64Count"/> function returns the number of System::UInt64 values used per
            coefficient. The <see cref="UInt64Count"/> function returns the number of System::UInt64 values used to store
            all coefficients. Each coefficient is stored in an identical format to <see cref="BigUInt"/>, with the least 
            quad word first and the order of bits for each quad word dependent on the architecture's System::UInt64 
            representation. For each coefficient, the bits higher than the coefficient bit count must be set to zero to 
            prevent undefined behavior. The <see cref="Pointer"/> function returns a pointer to the first System::UInt64 
            of the array.
            </para>

            <para>
            Both the copy constructor and the Set function allocate more memory for the backing array when needed, 
            i.e. when the source polynomial has a larger backing array than the destination. Conversely, when the 
            destination backing array is already large enough, the data is only copied and the unnecessary higher degree 
            coefficients are set to zero. When new memory has to be allocated, only the significant coefficients of the 
            source polynomial are taken into account. This is is important, because it avoids unnecessary zero coefficients 
            to be included in the destination, which in some cases could accumulate and result in very large unnecessary 
            allocations. However, sometimes it is necessary to preserve the original coefficient count, even if some of 
            the leading coefficients are zero. This comes up for example when copying individual polynomials of ciphertext 
            <see cref="BigPolyArray" /> objects, as these polynomials need to have the leading coefficient equal to zero 
            to be considered valid by classes such as <see cref="Evaluator"/> and <see cref="Decryptor"/>. For this purpose 
            BigPoly contains functions <see cref="DuplicateFrom" /> and <see cref="DuplicateTo"/>, which create an exact 
            copy of the source BigPoly.
            </para>

            <para>
            An aliased BigPoly (which can be determined with <see cref="IsAlias"/>) is a special type of BigPoly that does 
            not manage its underlying System::UInt64 pointer that stores the coefficients. An aliased BigPoly supports most 
            of the same operations as a non-aliased BigPoly, including reading/writing the coefficients and assignment, 
            however an aliased BigPoly does not internally allocate or deallocate its backing array and, therefore, does not 
            support resizing. Any attempt, either explicitly or implicitly, to resize the BigPoly will result in an exception 
            being thrown. Aliased BigPoly's are only created internally.
            </para>

            <para>
            In general, reading a BigPoly is thread-safe while mutating is not. Specifically, the backing array may be 
            freed whenever a resize occurs or the BigPoly is destroyed, which would invalidate the address returned by 
            <see cref="Pointer"/> and the coefficients returned by the indexer property. When it is known a resize will 
            not occur, concurrent reading and mutating is safe as long as it is known that concurrent reading and mutating 
            for the same coefficient will not occur, as the reader may see a partially updated coefficient value. A non-aliased 
            BigPoly allocates its backing array from the global (thread-safe) memory pool. Consequently, creating or resizing 
            a large number of BigPolys can result in performance loss due to thread contention.
