    For better performance, SEAL implements the "FullRNS" optimization of FV, as 
    described in https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/510.
    */

    /*
    The first task is to set up an instance of the EncryptionParameters class.
    It is critical to understand how these different parameters behave, how they
    affect the encryption scheme, performance, and the security level. There are 
    three encryption parameters that are necessary to set: 

        - poly_modulus (polynomial modulus);
        - coeff_modulus ([ciphertext] coefficient modulus);
        - plain_modulus (plaintext modulus).

    A fourth parameter -- noise_standard_deviation -- has a default value of 3.19 
    and should not be necessary to modify unless the user has a specific reason 
    to and knows what they are doing.

    The encryption scheme implemented in SEAL cannot perform arbitrary computations
    on encrypted data. Instead, each ciphertext has a specific quantity called the
    `invariant noise budget' -- or `noise budget' for short -- measured in bits. 
    The noise budget of a freshly encrypted ciphertext (initial noise budget) is 
    determined by the encryption parameters. Homomorphic operations consume the 
    noise budget at a rate also determined by the encryption parameters. In SEAL 
    the two basic homomorphic operations are additions and multiplications, of 
    which additions can generally be thought of as being nearly free in terms of 
    noise budget consumption compared to multiplications. Since noise budget 
    consumption is compounding in sequential multiplications, the most significant 
    factor in choosing appropriate encryption parameters is the multiplicative 
    depth of the arithmetic circuit that needs to be evaluated. Once the noise 
    budget in a ciphertext reaches zero, it becomes too corrupted to be decrypted. 
    Thus, it is essential to choose the parameters to be large enough to support 
    the desired computation; otherwise the result is impossible to make sense of 
    even with the secret key.
    */
    EncryptionParameters parms;

    /*
    We first set the polynomial modulus. This must be a power-of-2 cyclotomic 
    polynomial, i.e. a polynomial of the form "1x^(power-of-2) + 1". The polynomial
    modulus should be thought of mainly affecting the security level of the scheme;
    larger polynomial modulus makes the scheme more secure. At the same time, it
    makes ciphertext sizes larger, and consequently all operations slower.
    Recommended degrees for poly_modulus are 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768,
    but it is also possible to go beyond this. Since we perform only a very small
    computation in this example, it suffices to use a very small polynomial modulus.
    */
    parms.set_poly_modulus("1x^2048 + 1");

    /*
    Next we choose the [ciphertext] coefficient modulus (coeff_modulus). The size 
    of the coefficient modulus should be thought of as the most significant factor 
    in determining the noise budget in a freshly encrypted ciphertext: bigger means
    more noise budget. Unfortunately, a larger coefficient modulus also lowers the
    security level of the scheme. Thus, if a large noise budget is required for
    complicated computations, a large coefficient modulus needs to be used, and the
    reduction in the security level must be countered by simultaneously increasing
    the polynomial modulus. 
    
    To make parameter selection easier for the user, we have constructed sets of 
    largest allowed coefficient moduli for 128-bit and 192-bit security levels
    for different choices of the polynomial modulus. These recommended parameters
    follow the Security white paper at http://HomomorphicEncryption.org. However,
    due to the complexity of this topic, we highly recommend the user to directly 
    consult an expert in homomorphic encryption and RLWE-based encryption schemes 
    to determine the security of their parameter choices. 
    
    Our recommended values for the coefficient modulus can be easily accessed 
    through the functions 
        
        coeff_modulus_128bit(int)
        coeff_modulus_192bit(int)

    for 128-bit and 192-bit security levels. The integer parameter is the degree
    of the polynomial modulus.
    
    In SEAL the coefficient modulus is a positive composite number -- a product
    of distinct primes of size up to 60 bits. When we talk about the size of the 
    coefficient modulus we mean the bit length of the product of the small primes. 
    The small primes are represented by instances of the SmallModulus class; for 
    example coeff_modulus_128bit(int) returns a vector of SmallModulus instances. 
    
    It is possible for the user to select their own small primes. Since SEAL uses
    the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) for polynomial multiplications modulo the
    factors of the coefficient modulus, the factors need to be prime numbers
    congruent to 1 modulo 2*degree(poly_modulus). We have generated a list of such
    prime numbers of various sizes, that the user can easily access through the
    functions 
    
        small_mods_60bit(int)
        small_mods_50bit(int)
        small_mods_40bit(int)
        small_mods_30bit(int)
    
    each of which gives access to an array of primes of the denoted size. These 
    primes are located in the source file util/globals.cpp.

    Performance is mainly affected by the size of the polynomial modulus, and the
    number of prime factors in the coefficient modulus. Thus, it is important to
    use as few factors in the coefficient modulus as possible.

    In this example we use the default coefficient modulus for a 128-bit security
    level. Concretely, this coefficient modulus consists of only one 56-bit prime 
    factor: 0xfffffffff00001.

    modulus determines the size of the plaintext data type, but it also affects 
    the noise budget in a freshly encrypted ciphertext, and the consumption of 
    the noise budget in homomorphic multiplication. Thus, it is essential to try 
    to keep the plaintext data type as small as possible for good performance.

    Plaintexts in the FV scheme are polynomials with coefficients integers modulo 
    plain_modulus. To encrypt for example integers instead, one can use an 
    `encoding scheme' to represent the integers as such polynomials. SEAL comes 
    with a few basic encoders:

    [IntegerEncoder]
    Given an integer base b, encodes integers as plaintext polynomials as follows. 
    First, a base-b expansion of the integer is computed. This expansion uses 
    a `balanced' set of representatives of integers modulo b as the coefficients. 
    Namely, when b is odd the coefficients are integers between -(b-1)/2 and 
    (b-1)/2. When b is even, the integers are between -b/2 and (b-1)/2, except 
    when b is two and the usual binary expansion is used (coefficients 0 and 1). 
    Decoding amounts to evaluating the polynomial at x=b. For example, if b=2, 
    the integer 
    
        26 = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1
    
    is encoded as the polynomial 1x^4 + 1x^3 + 1x^1. When b=3, 
    
        26 = 3^3 - 3^0 
    
    is encoded as the polynomial 1x^3 - 1. In memory polynomial coefficients are 
    always stored as unsigned integers by storing their smallest non-negative 
    representatives modulo plain_modulus. To create a base-b integer encoder, 
    use the constructor IntegerEncoder(plain_modulus, b). If no b is given, b=2 
    is used.

    [FractionalEncoder]
    The FractionalEncoder encodes fixed-precision rational numbers as follows. 
    It expands the number in a given base b, possibly truncating an infinite 
    fractional part to finite precision, e.g. 
    
        26.75 = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^(-1) + 2^(-2) 
        
    when b=2. For the sake of the example, suppose poly_modulus is 1x^1024 + 1. 
    It then represents the integer part of the number in the same way as in 
    IntegerEncoder (with b=2 here), and moves the fractional part instead to the 
    highest degree part of the polynomial, but with signs of the coefficients 
    changed. In this example we would represent 26.75 as the polynomial 
    
        -1x^1023 - 1x^1022 + 1x^4 + 1x^3 + 1x^1. 
        
    In memory the negative coefficients of the polynomial will be represented as 
    their negatives modulo plain_modulus.

    [PolyCRTBuilder]
    If plain_modulus is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 2*degree(poly_modulus), the 
    plaintext elements can be viewed as 2-by-(degree(poly_modulus) / 2) matrices
    with elements integers modulo plain_modulus. When a desired computation can be
    vectorized, using PolyCRTBuilder can result in massive performance improvements 
    over naively encrypting and operating on each input number separately. Thus, 
    in more complicated computations this is likely to be by far the most important 
    and useful encoder. In example_batching() we show how to use and operate on 
    encrypted matrix plaintexts.

    For performance reasons, in homomorphic encryption one typically wants to keep
    the plaintext data types as small as possible, which can make it challenging to 
    prevent data type overflow in more complicated computations, especially when 
    operating on rational numbers that have been scaled to integers. When using 
    PolyCRTBuilder estimating whether an overflow occurs is a fairly standard task, 
    as the matrix slots are integers modulo plain_modulus, and each slot is operated 
    on independently of the others. When using IntegerEncoder or FractionalEncoder
    it is substantially more difficult to estimate when an overflow occurs in the 
    plaintext, and choosing the plaintext modulus very carefully to be large enough 
    is critical to avoid unexpected results. Specifically, one needs to estimate how 
    large the largest coefficient in  the polynomial view of all of the plaintext 
    elements becomes, and choose the plaintext modulus to be larger than this value. 
    SEAL comes with an automatic parameter selection tool that can help with this 
    task, as is demonstrated in example_parameter_selection().

    Here we choose to create an IntegerEncoder with base b=2.

    around plain_modulus (0x400), and as a result we would no longer obtain 
    the expected result as an integer-coefficient polynomial. We can fix this
    problem to some extent by increasing plain_modulus. This would make sense,
    since we still have plenty of noise budget left.

    /*
    The problem here is that homomorphic operations on large ciphertexts are
    computationally much more costly than on small ciphertexts. Specifically,
    homomorphic multiplication on input ciphertexts of size M and N will require 
    O(M*N) polynomial multiplications to be performed, and an addition will
    require O(M+N) additions. Relinearization reduces the size of the ciphertexts
    after multiplication back to the initial size (2). Thus, relinearizing one
    or both inputs before the next multiplication, or e.g. before serializing the
    ciphertexts, can have a huge positive impact on performance.

    Another problem is that the noise budget consumption in multiplication is
    bigger when the input ciphertexts sizes are bigger. In a complicated
    computation the contribution of the sizes to the noise budget consumption
    can actually become the dominant term. We will point this out again below
    once we get to our example.

    Relinearization itself has both a computational cost and a noise budget cost.
    These both depend on a parameter called `decomposition bit count', which can
    be any integer at least 1 [dbc_min()] and at most 60 [dbc_max()]. A large
    decomposition bit count makes relinearization fast, but consumes more noise
    budget. A small decomposition bit count can make relinearization slower, but 
    might not change the noise budget by any observable amount.

    Relinearization requires a special type of key called `evaluation keys'.
    These can be created by the KeyGenerator for any decomposition bit count.
    To relinearize a ciphertext of size M >= 2 back to size 2, we actually need 
    M-2 evaluation keys. Attempting to relinearize a too large ciphertext with
    too few evaluation keys will result in an exception being thrown.

    We repeat our computation, but this time relinearize after both squarings.
    Since our ciphertext never grows past size 3 (we relinearize after every
    multiplication), it suffices to generate only one evaluation key.

    First, we need to create evaluation keys. We use a decomposition bit count 
    of 16 here, which can be thought of as quite small.

    However, note that the second relinearization does not change the noise
    budget by any observable amount. This is very important to understand when
    optimal performance is desired: relinearization always drops the noise
    budget from the maximum (freshly encrypted ciphertext) down to a fixed 
    amount depending on the encryption parameters and the decomposition bit 
    count. On the other hand, homomorphic multiplication always consumes the
    noise budget from its current level. This is why the second relinearization
    does not change the noise budget anymore: it is already consumed past the
    fixed amount determinted by the decomposition bit count and the encryption
    parameters. 
    
    We now perform a third squaring and observe an even further compounded

    These experiments suggest that an optimal strategy might be to relinearize
    first with evaluation keys with a small decomposition bit count, and later
    with evaluation keys with a larger decomposition bit count (for performance)
    when noise budget has already been consumed past the bound determined by the
    larger decomposition bit count. For example, above the best strategy might
    have been to use ev_keys16 in the first relinearization, and ev_keys60 in the

    trade-off. Luckily, in most use-cases it is not so critical to squeeze out

    In this example we show how to efficiently run SEAL in a multi-threaded
    application.
    
    SEAL does not use multi-threading inside its functions, but most of the
    tools such as Encryptor, Decryptor, PolyCRTBuilder, and Evaluator are by
    default thread-safe. However, by default these classes perform a large 
    number of allocations from a thread-safe memory pool, which can get slow
    when several threads are used. Instead, here we show how the user can create
    local memory pools using the MemoryPoolHandle class, which can be either
    thread-safe (slower) or thread-unsafe (faster). For example, here we use
    the MemoryPoolHandle class to essentially get thread-local memory pools.

    First we set up shared instances of EncryptionParameters, SEALContext,
    KeyGenerator, keys, Encryptor, Decryptor, Evaluator, PolyCRTBuilder.
    After these classes are constructed, they are thread-safe to use.
